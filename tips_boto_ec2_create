//main tips
  1. check the region consistency
  2. check boto2 or boto3 and which python library associated with your boto2/3
  3. not the complete guide, but just the general problems
  

//creating aws credentials 
    aws configure
    /*
     *make sure the region is consistent with the console&code
     *access_key & secret_key => user name & password
     *   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html
     *also change the permission for the user, allow s3 access
     */

//create a security group from CLI
    aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name my-sg --description "My security group"

    save doesn't work, we have to wirte a fp and save it ourselves (Type error)

//ssh into the instance
    ssh -i /path/my-key-pair.pem ec2-user@public_dns_name
